# Used Car Price Analysis

## Overview
This project is part of the **CPE203 Statistics for Computer Engineering** course. It focuses on analyzing used car data to identify key factors influencing car prices, helping improve market competitiveness and support data-driven decision-making.

### Key Objectives
- **Identify Pricing Factors**: Uncover critical variables affecting car prices.
- **Enhance Market Competitiveness**: Provide actionable insights to optimize pricing strategies.
- **Support Data-Driven Decisions**: Utilize statistical methods and visualizations to communicate findings.

## Dataset
The dataset includes used car listings with various attributes influencing car prices:
- **Car Name**: Model and make of the car.
- **Registration Year**: Year when the car was registered.
- **Insurance Validity**: Type of insurance coverage (e.g., Comprehensive).
- **Fuel Type**: Type of fuel used (e.g., Petrol, Diesel, CNG).
- **Seats**: Number of seats in the car.
- **Kms Driven**: Total distance driven by the car (in kilometers).
- **Ownership**: Number of previous owners (e.g., First Owner, Second Owner).
- **Transmission**: Type of transmission (e.g., Automatic, Manual).
- **Manufacturing Year**: Year the car was manufactured.
- **Mileage (kmpl)**: Car‚Äôs fuel efficiency (kilometers per liter).
- **Engine (cc)**: Engine capacity (in cubic centimeters).
- **Max Power (bhp)**: Maximum power of the engine (in brake horsepower).
- **Torque (Nm)**: Torque produced by the engine (in Newton meters).
- **Price (in lakhs)**: Car price in lakhs (Indian currency unit).

## Statistical Methods Used
- **Chi-square Tests**: Assess categorical relationships (e.g., between fuel type and price).
- **One-Way ANOVA**: Compare means across multiple groups (e.g., car prices based on transmission type).
- **Regression Analysis**: Identify correlations between car attributes and pricing.

## Key Findings üêû
- **Critical Variables**: Engine size, mileage, and manufacturing year are primary factors affecting car pricing.
- **Market Competitiveness**: Insights from the analysis help sellers price cars more competitively.
- **Customer Preferences**: Features such as fuel type and transmission influence customer choices.
- **Visualizations**: Various graphs and plots were created to clearly present insights, such as price distribution by fuel type and ownership.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of factors influencing car prices, aiding data-driven decision-making in car transactions. Businesses can leverage these insights to optimize pricing strategies and better align with market trends.
